A critical part of your resume as a new developer is your portfolio. Before
you have a strong set of internships, your university and projects define
your ability to obtain interviews.

Students should not be limited by the costs of cloud hosting when determining
what projects they want to build. Here are some ways to host your next side
project without paying for anything.

## Static Site

Static site hosts are a great way to release your front end projects for free.
I use GitHub Pages to host my portfolio site and Netlify to host other projects.
I like how easy it is to get started with both of these platforms. They both offer
relatively nice looking subdomains for free. Netlify also makes deploying more
complex projects easier. [#typescript](https://twitter.com/hashtag/typescript?src=hashtag_click)

- GitHub Pages
  - username.github.io
  - 10 builds per hour
- Netlify
  - app-name.netlify.com
  - 3 builds per minute
  - automates deployment

## GitHub Student Developer Pack

The GitHub Student Developer Pack is a great resource that provides cloud
hosting credits to high school and university students. You can get domain
registration for your side projects. A few cloud providers also give out
credits for students to use paid hosting services. Here are some notable
inclusions in the pack.

- name.com
  - 1 year domain name on a selection of 25 TLDs
- Namecheap
  - 1 year domain name registration on my-name.me
- AWS Educate
  - \$100 of AWS credits
- DigitalOcean
  - \$50 of cloud hosting credits
- Microsoft Azure
  - \$100 of Azure credits
- Heroku
  - Free Hobby Dyno for 2 years

## Serverless Functions

Designing your server side with stateless functions in mind from the start
can give you access to quite a few generous free tiers. Here are the free
offerings from a few major cloud providers. I recommend starting with GCP
due to the large limit and high quality documentation.

- IBM Cloud Functions
  - 5 million executions per month
  - Node.js, Python, Go, Swift, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#
- GCP Cloud Functions
  - 2 million executions per month
  - Node.js, Python, Go
